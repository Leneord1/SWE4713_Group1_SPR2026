~~~
Open a command terminal

node -v to check Node version; version 24.6 or higher
Once verified, pull the code from the GitHub repository by whatever means your IDE is setup for
~~~
## Github Rules
~~~
As of right now, I don't have any workflows setup, so all code should be uploaded to a personal branch then merged to develop.  

Once the workflows are setup, upload the code to your repository, wait for the tests to complete.  If they have passed, merge to develop.
